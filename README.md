# Automotive Repair Information System
This project simulates a real-world automotive repair shop system, designed to practice relational database modeling, normalization, and SQL implementation. The database was built by first creating an ER model, normalizing it to BCNF, and then implementing it using SQL. It includes structured tables for customers, vehicles, repair orders, employees, procedures, invoices, and line itemsâ€”ensuring efficient data management and integrity across the system.

## Data Sources
The system uses simulated data to represent realistic repair shop operations.

## Tools
- PostgreSQL: Used for data modeling, implementation, and query analysis
